      <p class="description"> As part of a January Independent Activities Period web development that I took during freshman year, I collaborated with a partner to develop a website that could serve as a resource hub and social network for international college applicants. Some of this website's features included secure Google log-in, a forum, and pdf upload functionality for sharing resources.</p>

      <p class="description"> During this past summer break, I worked as a research assistant for the Viral Communications group of MIT's Media Lab. I conceptualized and developed a web user interface that will allow users to interact with a generative machine learning musical partner using React JS. My work heavily involved investigating algorithmic and quantitative representations of music to parse MIDI input data, render sheet music from real time MIDI input, and set tempo using the Web MIDI API and abcjs.

    <p class="description"> Noting the issues within the Ethiopian education system that impede the country's development, I along with fellow Ethiopian MIT students set out to provide solutions. Our first project involved collaborating with the Brighter Generation organization to establish an in-person, month-long, project-based computer science and programming course for over 100 selected high school students in Ethiopia. The students were encouraged to use what they have learned to solve real-world problems such as career-matching, hospital data storage systems, and many others. I had the wonderful opportunity of independently leading a class of 30 students. </p>
