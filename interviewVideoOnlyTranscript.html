1) I hope to take away various technical skills and actively engage in the process of brainstorming, wireframing, making multiple models and improving upon them all to develop better software. I also hope to acquire important soft skills that are necessary in a professional collaborative environment such as clear communication and smooth team work. Additionally, I hope to improve my problem solving and critical thinking skills and looking at situations with a unique perspective and thinking creatively. I also hope to become comfortable with learning by doing and learning from the mistakes I make in a professional environment. As someone who is interested in a software engineering career, getting the chance to attain all of these skills in a professional collaborative environment with mentors who are Salesforce employees would be invaluable.

2) Applications are most often used to facilitate solutions to problems. Ayana is one such app. It is a virtual therapy app that helps BIPOC people find therapists of color. This is important since one’s experiences could best be understood by someone else with a similar experience or background. Moreover, in a healthcare system that sees the pain of POC as normal and unconcerning, POC healthcare workers would be best at treating POC patients. In the month-long programming course I led with fellow Ethiopian college students, we encouraged our students to look for issues in their communities and use programming skills taught in class to solve them and many came up with wonderful ideas to solve problems such as lack of awareness of career choices, lack of personal income of stay at home mothers, inefficient distribution of government aid food, and so on. This just goes to show the many community problems that websites and applications can be used to solve.

3) I would first try to understand where I could possibly be going wrong so carefully reading error messages or specifying what part of a concept I am not understanding. I would of course try to solve the problem on my own first. However, if I am struggling on it for too long, I will ask team members first as they may know and have some understanding of my tasks. If they can’t answer my question as well or if the scope of my question is too broad, I would ask my mentor. I would structure my question with an explanation of what I am trying to achieve, the error that I’m getting or where my confusion is, and then ask for help based on what my need is. 
<br/>
<br/>
4) Three questions I would ask are: 
How do you handle mistakes and failures in a professional environment when your work affects others? How to be both careful and unafraid to make mistakes and use them as a learning opportunity?
Any advice for a successful work-life balance?
How do you measure your professional and personal success? How have you seen yourself grow since you first started your career?
