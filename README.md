Reflection Question Answers
1) If you had more time, what would you like to incorporate into your website? How would it improve the userâ€™s experience? What challenges would you anticipate when trying to implement the feature?
   
   I would incorporate light and dark mode viewing options and cursor change which would give the user a choice that caters to their viewing needs. I would also incorporate highlighting or slight color change when hovering over a button which would make overall on-click actions clearer to the user. For my Relevant Experience page, if I were to add more projects, instead of having all of them on one page, I would make one project description visible at a time with right and left arrow buttons that would allow the user to access the other projects. This would ensure that the page wouldn't be crowded and that the user has control over which project they want to see.  
    
3) Why do you think web accessibility is important, and why did you choose your specific features to include?  
   Websites are made for human use. Thus, they should be easy to access and use for people without technical backgrounds meaning elements should be well organized and clearly labeled as needed. Web accessibility should not only include ease of use but also user comfort and catering to user needs. Examples of this are dark and light mode settings and no image/ no video options in the case one feels better for a user's eyes. This includes making sure that features are visible which I have done by using contrasting colors that are easy on the eye for the background and text, font types and sizes that are readible, and spacing/organizing each element in a neat way. I've also made sure that the user has choices and control of what they're viewing by including a navbar that allows users to jump between different pages of the website, a button to my resume, and buttons that redirect the user to no image and no video versions of pages.
