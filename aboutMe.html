  I'm Bereket Birbo, a second year student at MIT studying Computer Science and Engineering. Having applied to colleges as a biochemistry major, I never would have imagined studying Computer Science as it was a field I had never explored before. I took my first introduction to computer science class during freshman fall, and enthralled by the problem solving and creative thinking it involved along with its widespread applications in almost every other field, I have stuck with computer science ever since. Learning entirely new concepts and seeing my growth in understanding over time has been an enjoyable journey. I aspire to use my computer science knowledge and software development skills to create novel solutions to problems.

   Outside of academics, some activities I enjoy are crocheting, reading, watching K-dramas, cooking, and going on long walks.
